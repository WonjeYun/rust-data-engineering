You're correct to notice that the code from lines 74 to 78 is not producing any output. This is because of how the CSV reader works and how it's being used in your code. Let's break down what's happening:

1. In the `read_column_data` function, you iterate through all the records of the CSV file to create the `data` vector.

2. After this function completes, the internal cursor of the CSV reader has reached the end of the file.

3. When you try to iterate over the records again in the main function (lines 74-78), there are no more records to read because the cursor is already at the end of the file.

To fix this and be able to read the CSV data multiple times, you have a few options:

1. Reset the CSV reader:
   Unfortunately, the `csv::Reader` doesn't provide a method to reset its position. You would need to create a new reader.

2. Read all data into memory:
   You could read all the CSV data into a structure in memory (like a Vec<Vec<String>>) and then process it multiple times.

3. Use separate readers for different operations:
   Create new CSV readers for each operation you want to perform.

Here's an example of how you could modify your code to read the CSV twice:
